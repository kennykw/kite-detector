The detector was trained on 7-14 M LEI kites flying over water or snow.\r\n\r\nA small example program is provided which demonstrates how to use the classifier (see src/kite_classifier.cpp) .  The example program opens all images in a directory, places a red bounding box over all \r\ndetected kites, and then dislpays each image with bounding boxes.\r\n\r\n![Kites with red bounding boxes](http://beavercreekconsulting.com/img/kite-detector.png) \r\n\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\n\r\nInstall [OpenCV](http://docs.opencv.org/3.0.0/df/d65/tutorial_table_of_content_introduction.html) first.
